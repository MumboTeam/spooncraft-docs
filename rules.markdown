Please read the rules listed here and make sure you follow them while playing.

### 1. Follow all Discord server rules

This includes keeping all content in the server chat appropriate, not spamming, and all other server rules. Please make sure you have read and are familiar with them.

<details>
<summary>Discord Server Rules</summary>
<h3>1. Be wholesome</h3>
Treat others with kindness and respect. There is to be absolutely no harassment in any way shape or form. Don't be disruptive, this includes but is not limited to spam, blasting peopleâ€™s ears in voice chat, etc. Make sure to follow <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord's Community Guidelines</a>.
<h3>2. Keep things appropriate</h3>
Keep everything family friendly and non-controversial, including abbreviations. Keep topics relevant to the channel. No topics meant to incite a negative response/argument. Do not post memes unless they are Mumbo/Minecraft related.
<h3>3. Speak only in English</h3>
Our mod team is mostly composed of only English speakers and since we can only moderate what we understand English is the only language to be spoken in the text channels. Speaking in other languages is allowed in the voice channels, but if you are requested by other users to stop, please use another voice channel.
<h3>4. No inappropriate profiles</h3>
Usernames, nicknames and profile pictures are subject to the same rules as chat. Additionally, there is to be no impersonation of others.
<h3>5. No self promotion</h3>
Don't link to other servers here or post links to your own personal channels.
<h3>6. No alt accounts</h3>
Joining the server with an alt account will be viewed as trying to evade punishment you may receive on your main account. Attempting to do so will result in your alt account getting kicked from the server.
<h3>7. Staff have final verdict on rules</h3>
If a staff member asks you to stop doing something, you should stop. All of the staff reserve the right to ban/kick/mute anyone for any reason. If someone is causing trouble, we ask you to ping staff instead of trying to take care of it on your own.
<h3>8. Have a ðŸ¥„ moment every day</h3>
It's important, seriously.

### 2. No Stealing

Do not take from any chest on the server without explicit permission from the owner of the items. If you pick up a player's items from the ground return them immediately to the owner unless explicitly told otherwise.

### 3. No Griefing

Do not maliciously destroy other people's builds, whether it is using fire, TNT or just taking it down by hand, this simply will not be tolerated and will in most cases be met with an instant ban.

### 4. No Hacking or duplicating

The use of hacked clients is prohibited. This means that it is not permitted to use x-ray hacking (including x-ray texture packs), aimbot, autoclickers, etc. The use of vanilla bugs is allowed however duplication glitch exploitation is not permitted, with the only exception being one TNT duper allowed per player.

### 5. Do not maliciously kill other players

You may only kill players if you BOTH agree to PVP. Traps and ambushes within your base are not allowed unless the player is properly warned beforehand.

### 6. No offensive skins

If a staff member deems a skin to be inappropriate, you will be placed in jail until you change it. Failing to change it will result in a temp/perm ban.

### 7. Keep redstone clocks and farms to a minimum

Everybody wants a lag free server, so please make sure that any redstone clocks will turn off when you are not nearby (pressure plates are useful) and keep farm animals down to below 40 per farm.
